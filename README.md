  <h1>Problem Solving Solutions on Codeforces</h1>
  <p>
    This repository features my solutions to random Codeforces problems, implemented in C++. It offers a collection of solutions covering diverse problem domains and difficulty levels. Explore the code to gain insights into my problem-solving skills and C++ proficiency.
  </p>

  <h2>How to Use:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Clone the repository: <code>git clone https://github.com/Rehab-Adel/codeforces-problem-solutions.git</code></li>
    <li>Navigate to the specific problem folder: <code>cd 112A-Petya-and-Strings.cpp</code></li>
    <li>Open the solution file (e.g., `solution.cpp`) in your preferred C++ IDE or text editor.</li>
    <li>Compile and run the code to see the solution in action.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Feedback and Learning:</h2>
  <p>
    Feel free to review, provide feedback, and utilize these solutions for learning and practicing algorithmic problem-solving on Codeforces. You can also compare different solutions to the same problem for a better understanding of various problem-solving techniques.
